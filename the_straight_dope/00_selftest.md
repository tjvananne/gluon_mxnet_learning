# Working with NDArrays from MXNet

1. code out the four main ways to create NDArray from scratch
2. show how to access shape and size of the NDArray
3. show element wise operations (addition / multiplication / exponentiation)
4. show proper matrix multiplication - use example that requires a transpose
5. show the main ways to accomplish "in-place" computation
6. show examples of slicing NDArrays
7. show examples of broadcasting 
    - what is the default behavior?
    - how can you change that default behavior?
8. show how to convert from NDArray to numpy.ndarray and vice versa
9. show how to access context of an MXNet NDarray
    - show how to change the context as well
    - note: this might be challenging without a GPU...
